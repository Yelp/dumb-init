Description: Simple wrapper script which proxies signals to a child
 Docker runs your processes as PID1. The kernel doesn't apply default signal
 handling to PID1 processes, so if your process doesn't register a custom
 signal handler, signals like TERM will just bounce off your process.
 .
 This can result in cases where sending signals to a `docker run` process
 results in the run process exiting, but the container continuing in the
 background.
 .
 A workaround is to wrap your script in this proxy, which runs as PID1. Your
 process then runs as some other PID, and the kernel won't treat the signals
 that are proxied to them specially.
 .
 The proxy dies when your process dies, so it must not double-fork or do other
 weird things (this is basically a requirement for doing things sanely in
 Docker anyway).
